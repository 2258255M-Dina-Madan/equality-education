  <h1>The Attainment Gap</h1>
    <p>On this page, we discuss an important issue that we believe requires more attenion. The attainment gap is a major consequence of
      inequality in universities. Watch the 1 minute video below that explains what the attainment gap is and what causes it.</p>

  <h2>The Attainment Gap at Firt-Degree Level</h2>
  <p>The bar chart on the left represents the proportion of white students from the U.K and
      the proportion of black students from the U.K who achieved either a 1st or 2:1 in universities in England over a 9 year period.
      The percentage point (pp) is the difference between black and white students. This is the <a href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2019/bame-student-attainment-uk-universities-closing-the-gap.pdf">attainment gap</a>.<br><br>
      The chart reveals that in 2018-2019, there was a 22.1 pp difference between black and white students. This translates to over 80% of white students gaining a 1st or 2.1, and around 60% of black students gaining a 1st or 2.1. 
      Furthermore, comparing the results from 2010-2019, the pp difference between black and white students has only decreased by 4.9% over the 9 years.<br>
      We decided to focus our statistics only on one BAME group to 
      draw attenion to the fact that it is this group that requires signifact change in this area of higher education the most. However, this gap is not
      isolated to universities. It is one of many racial inequalities that black people face in the U.K.<br><br>
      The attainment gap is a complex issue and is the result of other inequalities that impact black student's experiences at university.
      For example, feelings of isolation and no sense of belonging, lack of support, and lack of confidence in the <a href="https://www-tandfonline-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1080/09612025.2019.1584151">university system.</a>
      The result of students facing these issues is not being awarded a high level degree. This in turn affects future opportunities, where
      graduate jobs and postgraduate courses often require candidates to have achieved a <a href="https://www.officeforstudents.org.uk/advice-and-guidance/promoting-equal-opportunities/effective-practice/black-asian-and-minority-ethnic-students/">first or upper second</a> in their undergraduate degree.
      Below we have outlined some of the actions that can be taken to close the attainment gap, outlined by the Universities UK in their, <a href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2019/bame-student-attainment-uk-universities-closing-the-gap.pdf">'Closing the Gap'</a> report.</p>

      <h2>Role Models</h2>
    <p> In a <a href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2019/bame-student-attainment-uk-universities-closing-the-gap.pdf">Universities UK 2019 survey</a>, 87% of particpants felt that a lack of role models affect BAME students overall attaiment at university. 
     Therefore, universities require more diverse senior staff. Efforts to ensure the academic staff in the U.K reflect the student body 
      is far behind, with only 35 proffessors being Black British Female compared to over 1200 white male proffesors in the U.K. This can be seen
      as a result of the attainment gap. It has created what is referred to as the <a href="https://www-tandfonline-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1080/09612025.2019.1584151">'leaky pipeline,'</a> where there is lack of representation 
      in academic staff due to BAME students facing difficulties going further than undergraduate studies. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="gallery-cell">
      <h2>The Curriculum</h2>
      <p>After lack of role models, curriculum delivery is the next biggest
        contributing factor to the attainment gap, according to the <a href="https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/policy-and-analysis/reports/Documents/2019/bame-student-attainment-uk-universities-closing-the-gap.pdf">Universities UK's survey</a> that reported 42% of BAME students wanted their curriculum to involve more BAME-specific content.
        For example, issues with diversity and discrimination. Some universities have undertaken curriculum and assesement reviews 
        in regards to BAME student engagement. This could be to include more BAME authors and speakers in a course.
        However, some of these reviews do not look at race as a standalone concern and look at other issues 
        such as gender and sexuality in the same review. Doing so, specific racial inequalities within the curriculum are lost. Also, these
        reviews should be open to student particpation to ensure first-hand experiences are accounted for and to reassure BAME students that a real 
        effort is being made by staff. </p>
      </div>
    <div class="gallery-cell">
      <h2>Sense of Belonging</h2>
      <p>Improving students' sense of belonging is a vital way in reducing the attainment gap. Feelings of isolation within university life is associated 
        with the culture of the university where there may be a lack of awarness and discussion about BAME issues that are affecting students.
        When issues of race and inequality for BAME students are not addressed, it may isolate them and stop them from integrating into the insitution's community.
        Educating all staff and students on BAME inequalities, including the attainment gap, can improve the experience of 
        students at university. Ensuring BAME students know that they are heard by the university
        will improve their overall success as a student.</p>
