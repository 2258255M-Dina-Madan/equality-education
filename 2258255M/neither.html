  <h1>Neither Diversity or Decolonisation?</h1>
    <p>If you have reached this far then we hope you have engaged with the debate and are considering what method is best to bring equality
    to education. As you can see, we have tried to weigh both options fairly providing arguments for and against for both diversity
    and decolonisation in two aspects of the curriculum; learning materials and teaching. However, there is a third side to this debate.
    Could neither diversity or decolonisation be the answer?</p>

<div class="diverse">
  <p>Many of those who are advocating for change in universities, have argued that both diversity and decolonisation have become buzzwords.
    For example, in inclusion initiatives in universities (punathambeker talk 2021) to be seen as more radical (Guardian, 2020).
    It has been argued that this has caused too much concentration on the curriculum rather than the actual institution (guardian, 2020)</p>
    <p>So what can be the solution if diversity or decolonisation are not the answer?</p>
    <p>In her talk, Ftouni (2021) states that decolonisation is a failed struggle if we donâ€™t fight against the neoliberalism of universities.
    Neoliberalism of univserities is the idea that higher education Insitutions are becoming increasing privatised and finicialised. 
    This is perptuated through the rise in student debt and cut to staff pensions across the U.K. This has created an elitism of 
    universities, where those who are from a higher socioeconomic status are able to thrive in this culture (Jackson, 2020). There are now
    demands for universities to offer free education (jackson 2020) and to make universities a public space (ftouni, 2021) so there are
    opportunities for all.</br>
    This neoliberalist system in universities is a product of Britain and its conservative values today (Akel, 2020 eachother.org).
    Therfore, Changes to learning and teaching may not be enough, we need to look further into the structure of universities and 
    alter the system that has been created. Education in Britian upholds British values. And these values are deep rooted in colonial history.
    These values create a system where certain forms of knowledge are taught over others. These forms of knowledge must be challenged to
    break this cycle (akel, 2020).<br>
    This is where our debate lies. Diversifying and Decolonising can be seen as approaches to change the state of education in Britian today.
    By liberating the university and those who teach and learn with in it, through altering the knowledge base that is formed, is how 
    neoliberalist ideals will be erased.</p>
