  <h1>What is the Debate?</h1>
  <p>This debate focusses on whether diversifying U.K universities' reading list, is an effective method in helping to 
    decolonise the university institution and improve the university experience of BAME students. Those who have engaged in this
    debate so far have contrasting ideas on whether this is successful. Some argue that the diverse reading list is a neccesisity to
    the voices that studens learn from are not just from one group of people. However, others argue that, although there are benefits
    to a diverse reading list, this is not enough to fully decolonise these insitutions. In order, to fully rid higher Education
    Insituitions (HEI) of racism, teaching practise requires change too.</p>

  <h1>What is the Historical Background?</h1>
  <p>Decolonisation can be defined as "acknowledging the impact of colonialism and undoing structures of power" (UWE Bristol). 
    It is vital to apply this to universities, particularly in the United Kingdom, where universities were historicaly financed 
    through the empire and slavery (Jackson, 2020). In modern times, universities can still be seen as perpeptuating colonial
    and Eurocentric ideology. Therefore, by decolonising these insitutions, knowledge will be free from colonial values too.
    Not only is knowledge a key demand of decolonising univerisities, but experience of BAME students is also affected. Racism
    in the the classroom and lack of diverse teaching staff are vital changes in the role of decolonisation. </p>

    <h1>What is the Purpose of our Website?</h1>
    <p>The aim of our educational website is to bring together resources and information to inform our readers on this 
        multifaceted issue that needs addressing. This website should make it clear that one solution, diversifying the reading list or 
        staff, to this problem is not enough. This is because colonialism and racisms are deep rooted in U.K universities. </p>

    <h1>Why is this Topic Important?</h1>
    <p>We strongly believe this debate is vital and requires more awarness. There are major consequences for BAME students if 
        this issue is not tackled. Currently, in the U.K, there are only 35 Black British female proffesors compared to over 1200
        white male proffesors. This shocking statistic is a result of the BAME students not progressing to post-graduates and 
        subsequently high positions in universities (Jackson, 2020). The affects of colonialism are rife in our universities, 
        and we need to address this.</p>
