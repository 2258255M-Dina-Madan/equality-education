  <h1>Learning in the Curriculum</h1>
  <p>Learning materials such as the reading list are a physical representation of the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-019-00446-9">knowledge</a> that teachers and proffesors provide to students.
    It ensures teaching sources are easily accessible and always available for <a href="https://www.gla.ac.uk/myglasgow/library/staff/readinglists/">students.</a> Overall, it provides the 
    wider context and background information to further enhance student's understanding of a topic.</p>

      Source: How Diverse is your Reading List?</a></p>
  </div>

  <div class="diversetext">
   <p>Using research results from a <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-019-00446-9">2019 study</a>, the video to the left demonstrates how a more inclusive and diverse reading list is required in U.K universities. 
    By adding more diverse voices to teaching resouces as a whole, not just in the reading list, it ensures students are learning from different voices and not just one single view. This ensures that knowledge can reflect
     the <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-019-00446-9">community</a> from which it is drawn.<br><br>
    Furthermore, proffessors providing learning materials from the Global South would bring these resources into the mainstream. However, providing these sources is not enough. Authors from the Global south
    put onto the reading list tend to only be as optional reading, and not <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dscx4h2l-Pk">essential reading material.</a>
    This portrays the message to BAME students that the work that originates from people with similar background to them are not valid perspectives.</p>
  <p>However, there are criticism to what diversifying the curriculum actually achieves. Adding more diverse authors to the reading list can be seen as a <a href= "https://monishaissano.medium.com/what-are-the-demands-of-decolonising-uk-universities-291a986c27a4performative">performative</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dscx4h2l-Pk">tokenisitic approach</a>. 
    This is because it may not truly alter and remove the <a href="https://eachother.org.uk/decolonising-the-curriculum-what-it-really-means/">European-centred knowledge</a> that exists in U.K univeristies. diversifying learning materials may change where students get their information from but it is how this information is taught and engaged with that will impact the knowledge gained.</p>

<h2>Decolonised learning materials for equality in education?</h2>
</div>

<!--Decolonising argument-->

  <div class="decolonisetext">
    <p>You may be wondering, "How is decolonising different to diversifying learning materials?" Well let's look at an example.
       UWE Bristol's library service started a campaign called, <a href="https://www.uwe.ac.uk/study/library/our-libraries/library-activities-and-groups/decolonising-your-library">'Decolonise my reading list campaign.'</a>
      The goal of this campaign was to transform the teaching material being used in the university. It involved a collaboration between staff, students and the library where students played an active role in ensuring the
      voices that they wanted to hear and learn about were part of their learning.</p>
    <p>This example demonstrates that decolonising does not equal diversify or just adding texts, it is a transformation. When done correctly, it puts colonialism at the <a href="https://camri.ac.uk/blog/articles/decolonising-the-curriculum-which-curriculum-how-and-by-whom/">centre</a> in order to 
      transform the knowledge base which remains by the West and <a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10734-019-00446-9">for the West.</a></p>
    <p>The 2 minute <a href="http://www.dtmh.ucl.ac.uk/videos/curriculum-white/">video</a> to the left provides an example of the narrative that can occur in a classroom when materials do not represent 
      more than one group. Deconolising reading lists subsequently decolonises the narratives that are learnt and directly questions colonialialism.
      Secondly, the video highlights the affects of a white reading list, where the majority can feel comfortable with not questioning the views and knowledge base they are learning from.</p>
      <p>However, decolonisng learning materials may not be the answer to liberating the curriculum. The example in the video discusses how it was a student that had to question why the reading list was white. Why should it be the students, particularly BAME students who have 
        to dismantle racism in the learning materials? Although student collaboration can be a positive, demonstrated in the UWE Bristol's campaign,
        it is not the responsibility of students to decolonise the learning materials they are given.</p>
