  <p>This video presents findings from the <a href="https://www.hesa.ac.uk/data-and-analysis/staff/working-in-he">Higher Education Statistics Agency</a> to demonstrate that the lack of representation
    in British univeristies is a serious concern. One factor of why this is the case, is discussed in the<a href="attainmentgap.html">
    The Attainment Gap</a> section. It is clear that Higher Education Insitutions must remove the barriers that are contributing to
    <a href="https://insights.uksg.org/articles/10.1629/uksg.475/">'the leaky pipeline'</a>. This is vital because, as discussed in the video, 
    a diverse staff body allows for diverse thoughts, diverse discussions, and provides minority students with a mentor who may have similar lived experiences
    to them.</p>
    So can a more diverse staff transform the Euro-centric knowledge base that makes up U.K universities?<br>
    <p>Diversity within staff ensures students feel represented and have role models. However, diversity can still exist
      in an insitution with <a href="https://eachother.org.uk/decolonising-the-curriculum-what-it-really-means/">Western bias</a>. BAME professors still teach from the white Western curriculum. After all,
      that is the knowledge that they also learned from at university.</p>

<h2>Decolonised teaching practise for equality in education?</h2>

<!--Decolonising argument-->

<div class="decolonisetext1">
    <p>Decolonising teaching practise, also referred to as decolonising pedagogy, is a well discussed action that many scholars believe can contribute to
     anti-racism in universities. This idea goes beyond who is teaching students, as the discussion on diverse teaching focussed on,
      and examines how certain subjects are being taught and addressed. Listen to the audio files to hear about how one <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G2ZSyRpbQTA&t=4s">university</a>
      module is implementing decolonial pedagogy. Their suggestions on student Collaboration, equality in the classroom, and acknowledging student's
      lived experiences are all vital solutions of how the structure of learning in universities can be changed for the better.</p>
      <p>Does this have the potenial to change knowledge that is deep rooted in colonialialism?<br>
        Scholar Dr Meleisa Ono-George believes exactly that. In her 2019 <a href="https://www-tandfonline-com.ezproxy.lib.gla.ac.uk/doi/full/10.1080/09612025.2019.1584151">paper,</a> she argues that with active student and staff particpation,
        the dominant knowledge base can be challenged and changed. Also, tt ensures students do not experience direct or indirect racism in the classroom
        as BAME issues are directly addressed.</p>
        <p>However, the audio files discuss one particular module where, anti racist teaching practise would be expected. A module on African films.
          What about subjects where race is not a topic of discussion? Outside of arts, humanities, and social sciences, how can decolonial
          pedagogy come into play?</p>
          <p>Perphaps not all teaching practise can be viewed through this politcal lens. This suggests that, for some subjects, diversifying teaching
           is a suitable approach instead.</p>
